I decided not to include the training files with the submission as they are too large.
To run the code place the "assignment_code.py" file in the same folder as the "test" and "train" files from the python CIFAR 100 dataset, and the "data_batch_1" and "test_batch" files from the python CIFAR 10 dataset. An image of how the files/folder should be set up in included in the appendix (at the bottom) of the report for clarity.

note: the scipy and numpy libraries are used in the solution so please make sure these libraries are present.

If you want to test the cifar10 and cifar100 datasets independantly you can change the mode on line 5 of the code.
mode 1 is cifar10, mode 2 is cifar100, mode 3 is both.

The code takes a while to run, on my laptop it took 703 seconds. I appologies for this.
When I run the code on the whole data set the accuracies where:
cifar100		18.22%
cifar100 coarse	9.67%
cifar100 fine	3.05%

if you don't have time for that change the constants section of the code (line 14 to line 26 of the assignment code) to this;
### CONSTANTS
number_svd_vectors=5 #Specifies the amount of data stored after dimensional reduction
progress_display_rate=5000 # Just used to show progress

# Size of the data sets
cifar10_training_set_size=10000
cifar10_test_set_size=1000
cifar10_num_labels=10

cifar100_training_set_size=10000
cifar100_test_set_size=1000
cifar100_num_coarse=20
cifar100_num_fine=100
This makes it run in 60 seconds.
