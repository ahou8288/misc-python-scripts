In 1981, I drew a short straw for the few places on our Sheffield University club minibus to go on a caving expedition to Crete.  I thought I might try and go by train, but a friend, Crispin, who had also drawn a short straw suggested we cycle there.  
I'd never toured before, but he had, so I figured we'd be OK. I bought a better bike (a Dawes Super Galaxy) packed my saddlebag as per his advice (strict weight limits!) and off we went for an amazing 3 month ride. 
It didn't all go perfectly. I got hypothermia after a day of heavy rain in France but was rescued by a couple who took us in. There was a tension dynamic  about what time to get up, he liked to lie in, I hoped for earlier, and we had to pick something in between. We both got heat stroke in Italy, and were laid up for days in a shocking state in an Olive grove. But there were so many awesome times, crossing the very high Grand St Bernard pass with ice everywhere and socks on our hands, swims in swirly rivers with magical castles... 
Over the years I've talked much about this trip with my wife, so we decided to try and do something similar together, on our tandem, now our kids are at University. 
My recollection is that the best bits from that trip long ago were in the mountains. So we have picked a mountainous route - ambitious, considering it wasn't easy last time when I was on a single bike and in my early twenties, but we will give it a try. 
Now we are just 9 weeks or so from the start of our 2017 trip.
